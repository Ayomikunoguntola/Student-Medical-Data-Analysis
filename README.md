#### Student-Medical-Data-Analysis

## Introduction 
This data set comprises of student's medical information. The information includes the student's age, height, weight, blood type, BMI, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, etc. With the following information, I provided a detailed analysis and derived insight to answer crucial questions for the institution. 


## Question 1 
What are the average values for the following for Male and Females (Age, BMI, Temperature, Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Cholesterol)?
Using the pivot table to analyze, I realized that males and females have similar averages across the various data. Something to point out is that even though they are pretty similar, the female students had a lower average age and cholesterol, but they had a higher average BMI,temperature, heart rate and blood pressure compared to their male counterparts.

To further visualize this data,  I used the 2-D column to show the similarities between the male and female averages, as documented below.

## Question 2 
What is the average Height and Weight for both Genders?

The  average height for the male students is 174.97 and the average weight  for them is 69.96. On the other hand the average height for the female students is 174.93 And their average weight is 69.98. Looking at the column it clearly shows the the similarity between both genders however, even though the average height of the male students are higher the female students have a higher average weight  compare to the male students. To visualize the average height and weight for male and female, I made use of the 2-D bar and both male and female have  similar weight and height average

## Question 3 
What is the number of students across the different Blood Groups

From the analysis above,there are 44,466 students in the A blood group,44,486 students in the AB blood group, 45,537 students in the B blood group and the O blood group has the highest number of students at 65,511 students. 

To futher analyse it, I used a 2-D line diagram to show the difference between the various blood group. it shows that about 65,000+ students have the O blood group. While the other blood group is leveled at about 44000+ per each blood group.

## Question 4 
What is the number of students who smoke and those who don’t

In this institution, we can say that about 18% of students are smokers and the other 81.99% are not

The 3D-Column below helps us visualize that data as we can see about 14,000+ students are smokers and 35,000+ are non smokers

## Question 5 

What is the number of Students who have diabetes and those who don’t

![](Diabetics_analysis.jpg) 

From the table above there are 18014 diabetic student and 161986 non diabetic students

I used the pie chart to visualize the data of diabetic and non diabetic student
